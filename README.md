A wrapper for coreos fleet - allowing scaling and rolling deploys of apps

## Installation

`admiral deploy someapp 4`
will submit `someapp@` service file, and start/rolling-restart 4 instances of it

`admiral scale someapp 5`
will start an additional instance of `someapp@`

`admiral scale someapp 3`
will destroy `someapp@4` and `someapp@5`

options:
- `--discovery`, `-d` also submits `someapp-discovery@` and runs 4 instances of it
